       In environments with high stellar density, three-body interactions are frequent and can give rise to the 
         dynamical formation of binary BHs (BBHs). These BBHs can then inspiral and merge emitting gravitational waves. 
         If their merger remnant is not ejected from the cluster, it can undergo further three-body encounters, 
         form new BBHs and go through new mergers. This process is called hierarchical mergers and can lead to the formation 
         of remnant BHs with progressively higher and higher mass. In the DEMOBLACK team, we developed a code called FASTCLUSTER 
         which simulates the hierarchical merger phenomenon in different environments: globular, young and nuclear star clusters 
         as well as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). I'm a developer of the FASTCLUSTER branch for the simulation of AGNs.<br> 
         The AGN environment stands out with respect to other potential hosts of hierarchical BBH mergers because of the presence of a dense 
         gaseous disk which fuels mass accretion onto a central super-massive BH (SMBH). The stellar-sized BHs orbiting the SMBH are thus subject 
         to strong gas torques and change their orbital properties, similarly to  what happens to planets in protoplanetary disks. This process generally 
         brings BHs closer to each other and significantly increases the rate of three-body interactions, thus leading to 
         the efficient production of higher-mass BHs. <br>
